# What is imPulse?
Energy harvesting alternative for bikes including data logging, smart illumination system and Power Distribution Board for powerbanks

# Description

The aim of this project is to provide a cost-effective alternative to power generation on bikes using conventional stepper motors while adding other capabilities, such as: 

- An integrated data logging system to monitor power generated on each trip. 

- A smart lighting system with addressable LEDs, working as indicators, braking lights and headlights, incorporating Light Dependant Resistors (LDRs) to sense the environment and to reduce the risk of glare. 

- Power Distribution Board (PDB) to charge two different/generic powerbanks. While one powerbank is charged, the other one is used to supply energy to the system. 

Please bear in mind that I am currently testing quick prototypes that may compromise the bike reliability in some cases (aka 'learn by doing'). No stress, compression, bending or torsion analysis have been carried out yet on the power generation stage, so use all this project content at your own risk. 

# Milestones

- Power Generation Stage (Minor changes needed)
- Data Logger Stage (Upgrading!)
- Smart Lighting System (Upgrading!)
- eBox Stage (Current stage)
